We may change our reference rate provider from time to time without notice to you.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">(b) For some currencies, we do not use the mid-market exchange rate, including where we are required to use a different reference rate for the exchange rate for your currency pair. For example, for currency conversions to Nigeria (NGN), we are required to use the rate set by the Central Bank of Nigeria. For these currencies we will notify you of the exchange rate offered by ZYNOPAY when you place your payment order.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">13.3 Guaranteed rates.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;We will notify you of the guaranteed rate and the guaranteed time period (the &quot;Guaranteed Period&quot;) when you create your Money Transfer.

You will see when we have received your money by logging into your ZYNOPAY Account.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">(c) If we receive your funds after the Guaranteed Period, we will not be able to convert your money using the guaranteed rate and your transfer will become a non-guaranteed rate transfer. Accordingly, we may convert your money at the applicable exchange rate at the time we receive your money or we will email you and ask you if you want to proceed with your transfer at the new exchange rate.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">(d) If the relevant exchange rate (as provided by our reference exchange rate provider) changes by 5% or more during the Guaranteed Period, we can, at our option, suspend your transfer for a reasonable period of time or cancel your transfer and refund the money to you.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">(e) For certain currencies, including where you are sending from Japanese Yen (JPY), the guaranteed rate will only be offered after your address has been verified by us.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">(f) We may change these guaranteed rate conditions or suspend the guarantee rate feature at any time.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">13.4 Auto Conversion.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For certain currencies, you may be able to set one or more conversion orders to be automatically executed once the exchange rate you pick is offered by our Services (an &ldquo;auto conversion order&rdquo;). There may be limits to the number of auto conversion orders you are able to set up, as well as the amounts of money you can schedule to convert. ZYNOPAY does not guarantee that it will be able to execute your auto conversion order in all circumstances. The auto conversation feature is to set up a preauthorised remittance payment transaction and is not a forward, derivative or other financial product or device. If you do not fund your preauthorised transfer it will be cancelled.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">13.5 We are not a currency trading platform.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Please note that we are not a currency trading platform, accordingly, you should not use our Services, including auto conversion orders, for this purpose (including creating multiple auto conversion orders without the intention of completing all the transfers or seeking to profit from FX trading). If we detect that you are using our Services for this purpose, we may, at our option, set a limit on the number of auto conversion orders you may create, set a limit on the amount of money you can convert with auto conversions, restrict your ability to use this or other features, or suspend or close your ZYNOPAY Account and seek disgorgement of your gains.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7 c1">14.

Until then, there is no relationship between us and the intended recipient and the money continues to belong to you. We will refund the money to you if the intended recipient does not claim the money or if they have failed our customer checks within a reasonable time period as determined by us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7 c1">15.
